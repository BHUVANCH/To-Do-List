# Features:

3)	Up on hitting the url: efficiencttech.com the browser will take us to login page, if you are already had an account you will be redirected to the next page else we must sign up.
4)	The signup Page you have to fill the details and login with your credentials then you will be redirected to the To-Do-lists in that the list names will be displayed along with open and delete buttons , If you are a new User you have to create your list first by clicking Create button 
and after Making any change you must have to click on save changes to store in database .

9)	These changes are notified to the user by notifications and email. So that he will never miss any update.
10)	I had kept viewers list instead of friends list for each to do list, so that he can share a particular list to friends or employees without giving access to other To-Do-lists of user.
